### Introduction
The Knapsack Problem is a well-known optimization problem in computer science and operations research. It involves selecting a subset of items with specific values and weights to maximize the total value while not exceeding a given capacity constraint. This repository provides JavaScript implementations of different algorithms to solve the Knapsack Problem efficiently.

### Usage
To use the Knapsack Problem solver, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using the following command:
`git clone https://github.com/Bilal-Belli/KnapsackProblem.git`
2. Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

3. The web page will present you with an interface to enter the item details and the capacity limit.

4. Select the algorithm you want to use from the available options.

5. Click the "Solve" button to see the solution for the Knapsack Problem.
